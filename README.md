# MitoSheet
## üõ† Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- `pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis  
- `mitosheet` - Interactive spreadsheet for data exploration  
- `numpy` - Numerical operations (implicitly used by pandas)  

## üìå Key Steps Performed  

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**  
   - Imported datasets:  
     - `Sleep_health_and_lifestyle.csv`  
     - `SalesTarget.csv` (multiple times)  
     - `survey.csv`  
   - Handled missing values in `Sleep Disorder` column by filling NaN with "No".  

2. **Data Transformation**  
   - Pivoted `Sleep_health_and_lifestyle` to analyze stress levels by occupation and physical activity.  
   - Split the `Blood Pressure` column into two separate columns (`–°–ê–î` and `–î–ê–î`) and converted them to float.  
   - Created a new binary column `–í–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—à–µ 35` (Age over 35) based on the `Age` column.  

3. **Data Type Conversion**  
   - Converted columns to appropriate data types:  
     - `Stress Level`, `Heart Rate`, `Physical Activity Level`, `Daily Steps`, `Age` ‚Üí float  
     - `Timestamp` and `Order Date` ‚Üí datetime  

4. **Data Merging and Concatenation**  
   - Concatenated `SalesTarget` and `survey` dataframes.  
   - Attempted a merge between `SalesTarget` and `survey` on `Order Date`, filtering for unmatched entries.
